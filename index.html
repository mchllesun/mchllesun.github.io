            I'm an undergraduate student in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto,
            studying in the Robotics Engineering major. Outside of my life on campus, I enjoy swimming, 
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/152791478-michelle">reading</a>, drawing, dabbling in graphic
            design, and watching animated films. Part of my initial inspiration to pursue robotics was actually the 
            animated Disney film <i>Big Hero 6</i>, which I first watched back in 2014! (I'm also a huge fan of cats.)

        <ul>
            <li>I've been a part of the student-run non-profit organization <a href="https://seds.ca/">SEDS-Canada</a> since <b>September 2021</b> - my first month of university.
                The overarching missions of SEDS is to promote student involvement in the space sector through unique opportunities such as
                conferences, events, and projects. Currently, I serve as the <b>Vice President External</b>, which I was elected for back in April 2023! As VP External, I:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Work with 9 other elected <a href="https://seds.ca/board-of-directors/">directors</a> to run SEDS-Canada, overseeing
                70+ staff members from across the country</li>
                <li>Act as the point of communication for external collaboraters, including event partners and sponsors, international SEDS chapters, and our
                <a href="https://seds.ca/board-of-advisors/">Board of Advisors</a></li>
                <li>Recently brought back the <a href="https://seds.ca/mentorship/">mentorship program</a></li> after almost a year of hiatus! This is an opportunity for
                students to connect with space industry professionals for guidance and insight on the Canadian space sector
            </ul>

            <li>Before being elected as VP External, I was the <b>graphic designer</b> for the conference team, primarily working to organize and run the annual <a href="https://csc.seds.ca/">Canadian Space Conference</a>.
            I also had the chance to work on some other cool graphics for SEDS-Canada!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Created all visual elements for both the 2022 and 2023 Canadian Space Conferences (formerly known as Ascension), including website graphics, social
                media posts, physical banners and posters, merchandise, and more</li>
                <li>Designed and created the posters and patches for all <a href="https://seds.ca/officially-launching-our-2022-2023-projects-and-events/">2022/2023 projects and events</a>.
                The mission patches for CAN-RGX and CAN-SBX were also later <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvd5jhbLB0S/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">manufactured into physical patches</a> 
                and given to all project participants</li>
