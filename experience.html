            <p>I've been a part of the student-run non-profit organization <a href="https://seds.ca/">SEDS-Canada</a> since <b>September 2021</b> â€• my first month of university.
                The overarching missions of SEDS is to promote student involvement in the space sector through unique opportunities such as
                conferences, events, and projects. Currently, I serve as the <b>Vice President External</b>, which I was elected for back in April 2023! As <b>VP External, I...</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Work with 9 other elected <a href="https://seds.ca/board-of-directors/">directors</a> to run SEDS-Canada, overseeing
                70+ staff members from across the country</li>
                <li>Act as the point of communication for external collaboraters, including event partners and sponsors, international SEDS chapters, and our
                <a href="https://seds.ca/board-of-advisors/">Board of Advisors</a></li>
                <li>Recently brought back the <a href="https://seds.ca/mentorship/">mentorship program</a> after almost a year of hiatus! This is an opportunity for
                students to connect with space industry professionals for guidance and insight on the Canadian space sector </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Before being elected as VP External, I was the <b>graphic designer</b> for the conference team, primarily working to organize and run the annual <a href="https://csc.seds.ca/">Canadian Space Conference</a>.
            I also had the chance to work on some other <b>cool graphics for SEDS-Canada!</b> It's always incredibly fulfilling to be able to combine my hobbies
            with my professional and academic interests, especially in such a meaningful way. I always make an effort to maintain my artistic pursuits alongside my engineering education!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created all visual elements for both the 2022 and 2023 Canadian Space Conferences (formerly known as Ascension), including website graphics, social
                media posts, physical banners and posters, merchandise, and more</li>
                <li>Designed and created the posters and patches for all <a href="https://seds.ca/officially-launching-our-2022-2023-projects-and-events/">2022/2023 projects and events</a>.
                The mission patches for CAN-RGX and CAN-SBX were also later <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvd5jhbLB0S/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">manufactured into physical patches</a> 
                and given to all project participants</li>
            </ul>

        <p>I am currently an associate at <a href="https://www.yourenext.ca/">You're Next Career Network</a>, as part of the <a href="https://www.yourenext.ca/team">Digital Launchpad team</a>!
        YNCN is a student-run career network at the University of Toronto, working to help students discover potential career paths and connect with companies. As a <b>Digital Launchpad associate...</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed the user interface of an interactive map for YNCN's biannual career fairs</li>
            <li>Aided in troubleshooting design-related technical issues in the map's development. Doing this is also what inspired me to

            <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> <a href="https://lin.csb.utoronto.ca/">Lin Lab</a> @ the University of Toronto
        </h2>
        <p>During the summer of 2023, I was funded by the <b>ESROP - U of T fellowship</b> and the <b>CSB Undergraduate Research Award</b> to work at the Lin Lab. 
            The lab focuses on the study of systems neuroscience, specifically through implementing neuroimaging and computational tools to animal models 
            to understand the neurodynamics behind cognition. My project aimed to create a virtual reality (VR) system for zebrafish, a popular model 
            organism in neurobehavioural research. This unique opportunity combined biology, mechanical design, software, and optics, all of which are 
            part of the many interdisciplinary fields I hoped to explore in my undergraduate years.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed an interactive, real-time VR system using C#, Python, and the Unity game engine. Learning Unity was a very exciting experience, 
                and I found the program to be incredibly fun to use! I hope to explore more 3D modelling and game design software</li>
            <li>Designed and built a VR platform compatible with neuroimaging microscopes using Arduinos, <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/">optomechanical components</a>, 
                and 3D printed parts</li>
            <li>Designed and realized a <a href="https://lin.csb.utoronto.ca/2023/09/06/our-lab-has-a-logo/">logo</a> for the lab! It combines many elements of the lab's 
            expertise: a larval zebrafish representing the model organism, a microscope for neuroimaging, and a brain network to represent the study of neuroscience.</li>
        </ul>

        July 2022 to May 2023! Simply known as <i>Stores</i> to the engineering student body, it is one of the University of Toronto Engineering
        Society's non-profit commercial operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed merchandise targeted towards engineering students! Some items I've designed include keychains, patches, shirts, and more.</li>

        <p>In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Sarah Haines and her lab group, 
            which specializes in indoor microbiology and environmental quality. Funded by the <b>ESROP - U of T fellowship</b>, my project 
            focused on developing more efficient methods of particle collection for microbial analysis. As my first research experience, I stepped foot into the fields of microbiology, 
            building science, and public health, while also developing useful research skills and gaining exposure to a lab environment!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed and tested various particle collection methods for microbiological analyses</li>
            <li>Utilized qPCR, RNA extraction, and DNA extraction to quantify SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in collected samples</li>
            <li>Wrote both adapted and original standard operating procedures for experimental techniques</li>
        </ul>
